<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Sophia Lawrence Hawkins and I am a student studying at Oxford Brookes University. I am in my second year of university for my BA Honours degree in Media, Journalism and Publishing.</p>
<p>I was born in the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford in 2002 and have lived in the local area for all of my life.</p>

<p>I did my GCSE's and then went on to do further studies at A-Level. I studied media, drama and sociology and with studying media it grew my interest for what it would be like working in the media industry.</p>
<p>Oxford is the hub for media, especially publishing, which makes it a great place to study and learn about the workings of the industry in a real life setting.</p>

<p>My main interest and hobbie that I have had all of my life has been dancing.</p>
<p>I started dancing at the age of 3, partaking in both ballet and tap. However, I stoppd ballet dancing after 13 years but continued with tap dancing.</p>
<p>I carried on dancing until I was 17 years old and then had to finish due to starting at University.
<p>I also used to help teach the younger students as I wanted to enhance their capabilities.</p>
<p>I used to partake in dancing shows in The Wycombe Swan Theatre in High Wycombe biannually.</p>

<p>Another interest of mine is music.</p>
<p>I have always loved music and due to me being a dancer I have a dancer's connection with music.</p>
<p>As a child my grandma used to listen to music with me and certain songs hold special meaning to me.</p>
