<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Sophia Lawrence Hawkins and I am a student studying at Oxford Brookes University. I am in my second year of university for my BA Honours degree in Media, Journalism and Publishing.</p>
<p>I was born in the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford in 2002 and have lived in the local area for all of my life.</p>

<p>I did my GCSE's and then went on to do further studies at A-Level. I studied media, drama and sociology and with studying media it grew my interest for what it would be like working in the media industry.</p>
<p>Oxford is the hub for media, especially publishing, which makes it a great place to study and learn about the workings of the industry in a real life setting.</p>
