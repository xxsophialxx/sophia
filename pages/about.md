My name is Sophia and I was born in England and have lived in Oxford for all of my life. I am 19 years old and I am currently studying Media, Journalism and Publishing at Oxford Brookes University.

I have always had a strong interest in music and it has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, whether that be hearing the music my parents listen to or my own. I believe that music can represent emotions as well as allow people to feel emotions they have never felt before. Music can provide a source of comfort for me especially in times of need and allows me to feel like I am not the only one feeling certain feelings. That is why music is so important to me and plays a major role in my day-to-day life.
