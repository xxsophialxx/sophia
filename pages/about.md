My name is Sophia and I was born in England and have lived in Oxford for all of my life. I am 19 years old and I am currently studying Media, Journalism and Publishing at Oxford Brookes University.

I have always had a strong interest in music and it has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, whether that be hearing the music my parents listen to or my own. Albums covers are what we see when we listen to music, it used to be on the CD we buy but now it is mainly digital. I wanted to identify the difference in album art through different time periods to see how society and the context of the time and which genre was most popular has affected what cover art looks like and the typography present. 

I believe that music can represent emotions as well as allow people to feel emotions they have never felt before. Music can provide a source of comfort for me especially in times of need and allows me to feel like I am not the only one feeling certain feelings. That is why music is so important to me and plays a major role in my day-to-day life.
